# justask

Turns what a person types in plain language into an app's own state: search results, table filters, a filled record card. Code finds the candidates (parsed dates, times and amounts; a shortlist of the host app's catalog rows), a provider model picks one label per question with a probability for every label, and code builds the result. A field the model is unsure of stays empty for the person to fill, and nothing reaches the host app until the person confirms.

The first provider is Jev (TypeSafe, `@typesafe-ai/sdk`). Any model that answers every question in one call with a probability for every label can be added without touching the core.

## Status

Private and unpublished. `package.json` sets `"private": true`, so npm refuses to publish it. The domain is described in [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md), the product in [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md), and decisions in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

## Entry points

| Import | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `justask` | The core, no UI: `ask` and the provider contract |
| `justask/react` | The React layer (hooks and unstyled pieces) |
| `justask/jev` | The Jev provider adapter |

## Development

Requires Node 24 and pnpm 12 (the version is pinned in `package.json`; `corepack enable` picks it up).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm lint        # Biome: lint and format check
pnpm format      # Biome: apply fixes and formatting
pnpm typecheck   # tsc, strict
pnpm test        # Vitest, once
pnpm build       # emit dist/
```

Tests never call a real provider. They use the fake provider in `test/fake-provider.ts`, which returns fixed probabilities per question label. Real calls happen only in eval runs, by hand, with a key copied from `.env.example` into `.env`.
